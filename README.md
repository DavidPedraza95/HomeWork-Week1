# Homework-Week1

This contains homework for week 1
In this homework, we cleaned up the CSS and HTML by elminiating redundant classes and using 1 class for each benefit/ service.
Comments are also properly labeled in the CSS file.
We also edited the html file itself to link components within the file, this allowed all three headers to function properly
